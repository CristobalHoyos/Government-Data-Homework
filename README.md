# Government-Data-Homework

My chosen data set is interesting to me because it shows a debt to income ratio which can be considered as one major factor in measuring a country's standard of living and the overall financial well being of its citizens a concept ive seen previously at economics class at school. I care to explore further, since I wonder what factors affect indexes like the Happy Planet Index that measures each countryÂ´s happiness and many others to understand how they are weighted and how thier data is collected. The column I selected shows the lower bound of the debt-to-income ratio by state, then all the states are added up to see which is the general trend and average debt. What the chart revealed is hard to analyse since most frequencies are constant, therefore we must find the mean and the median. Both of them are consistent at 1.47 which is considerably high, meaning that most Americans actually have more debt than income per year.
